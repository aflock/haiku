-- 1/5/14
Foggy City lights
Soft and warm in a cold sky
As I walk below

-- 1/8/14
Crowded subway car
Hands of seven colors grab--
balance; headed home

-- 1/9/14
Cold day- warm cafÃ©
Taste of coffee thawing me
While couples chatter

-- 1/9/14 JFK->SFO
Frozen mists hang still
A small town's street lights below
Winter stars above

-- 1/10/14
Birds chirping under
A California tree's shade
Sing the warmth goodbye


-- 1/12/14
Dying sun's colors
Smell of burning wood drifts down
The road hugging hills


-- 1/16/14
Seen through subway windows
The jeweled skyline retreating
Behind bridge's steel

-- 1/17/14
Flurry of feathers
Sweep under crisp winter's sun;
Man and pidgeons chat

-- 1/23/14
Bubbles in a pool
Turquoise lights dance below me
Cali stars above

-- 1/24/14
Jeweled hills rising
Falling darkly on the road
We glide through, chatting

-- 1/27/14
A cigarette break
Shared between two non-smokers
Smoldering ashes

-- 1/30/14
Dew hangs on lillies
Fragile petals tremble now
By El Camino

-- 2/1/14
This lavendar bush
Its fragrance dusts my hands
Color dusts my eyes

-- 2/2/14
Damp cherry blossoms
A ray of sun cuts through clouds
Snowfall of petals

-- 2/4/14
Sun peeks over hills
Announcing dawn with colors
Forged by the night's dreams

-- 2/6/14
A dark room; one light
Illuminates the dust specks
As I write haiku

-- 2/9/14
Leaving as snow falls
The bright city blanketed
I'll return in Spring

-- 2/10/14
Seven laptops glow
Seventy fingers typing
Chorus of code


-- 2/14/14
Dusk over Bay Bridge
Clouds roll over dark forests
Driving to Oakland

-- 2/15/14
Alcatraz Island
Drifts by - grey and abandoned
Metal sky; sea breeze

-- 2/16/14
Watching bright sunsets
As waves batter jagged rocks;
Turquoise succulents

-- 2/17/14
Walking empty streets
Holding hands, we say nothing
Nothing left unsaid

-- 2/18/14
Night; Highway driving
Solitary drivers trade lanes
Group meditation

-- 2/24/14
A sip of coffee
Shaking the sleep from my eyes
The dust from my bones

-- 2/25/14
Sun shines on concrete
Slanted shadows meet the wall
Lost my sunglasses

-- 2/26/14
Rain beats down concrete
Tattoos the end of a drought
Lost my umbrella

-- 3/2/14
Snow falls with the night
I forgot my sweater, so
Her smile keeps me warm

-- 3/3/14
Sunset; Paintbrush skies
Tides of clouds on seas of air
Flash gold, then darkness

-- 3/3/14 L train USQ->DeKalb
Salt-stained subway floor
Scuffed winter boots and black coats
This season's commute

-- 3/4/14
City grit and sounds
Chaos and harmony blend
Rats run underfoot

-- 3/6/14
Sleep settles on me
Night settles the sun's retreat
Stars wander through clouds

-- 3/8/14
Sun on her soft face
She drifts in between my dreams
A flower, sleeping

-- 3/11/14
Bits bounce between us
Thoughts exchanged over copper
Pixelated chill


-- 3/14/14
A pidgeon perches
On a gray stone gargoyle
City's audience

-- 3/17/14
Black and white stones fight
Placed by silent generals
Peaceful war, for once

-- 3/18/14
Painted eyes glance up
Black hair, black jacket, black boots
Flash of golden rings

-- 3/23/14
Biking in Brooklyn
Rubber feathers, on steel wings
Flying over concrete

-- 3/24/14
After a long day
Her body is warm iron
My bones warm magnets

-- 3/26/14
Last leg of Winter
Looks like it'll be rainstorms
That send it away

-- 3/28/14
Spinning up boxes
Replicas at fingertips
Conjure love from bits

-- 4/1/14
Fragrant pink tulips
Blooming through the dull colors
That subways provide

-- 4/2/14
Strangers' cigarettes
Bummed in city communion
Burnt to ash and smoke

-- 4/3/14
Rain-slicked Bushwick streets
Bright graffiti hangs solemn
Watching me walk home


-- 4/5/14
Dark karaoke
Sapporo spilled on the couch
Can't dampen spirits


-- 4/8/14
Cold rain on Broadway
Old man under an awning
Pulls on an e-cig

-- 4/9/14
First tendrils of Spring
Poking through the gray concrete
We're both waking up

-- 4/10/14
White magnolia
Blooming in the project's shade
Petals fall silent

-- 4/11/14
My leather boots
Pass lights of an idle car
Shadows kicking dust

-- 4/12/14
Blooming New Yorkers
The city is a playground
Now the sun is out

-- 4/12/14 Morgan -> Bedford
Smoky Tobacco
Rolled quick by shaking fingers
Between subway stops

-- 4/13/14
A tendril of hair
Cast against her rosy cheek
Bright laughter in bed


-- 4/22/14
Rusted subway tracks
Water-rotten beams hold tons
Rats scurry under

-- 4/23/14
Both ends of my day
Exhausted on the L train
Subway keeps running

-- 4/24/14
Abandoned red bike
Slowly slumps on the sidewalk
Missing a back wheel

-- 4/26/14
Seven friends' faces
Lifting my fatigue with warmth
Laughter in loud bars

-- 4/27/14
Lights cut through darkness
Music flows through my body
Brightening the earth


-- 4/29/14
Raindrops bounce on steel
Yellowed by a sole street lamp
As black cars drive by



-- 5/5/14
The petals bright pink
Reflected in the sunset
Reflected in me


-- 5/9/14
Hair rippling gold
Tied up but now escaping
Moved by subway wind

-- 5/10/14
Dodging summer rain
As horses draw carriages
Around Central Park

-- 5/11/14
Light the charcoal quick!
Before it burns your fingers
Summer sun watching

-- 5/13/14
Inhale stale subways
Smothered, I need a fresh breath
I need a fresh breath

-- 5/14/14
Cabs coat the city
Vessels on a concrete sea
"Where are you headed?"

-- 5/15/14
An old friend's smile
Strikes my heart through years passed by
My heart remembers

-- 5/17/14
Gliding over clouds
The suburbs give way to fields
Highway's veins pass through


-- 5/18/14
Breeze of the river
Runs through the restaurant with sun
Steamed crabs and punch bowls


-- 5/22/14
Silver-gold sunbeams
Coating columns at sunset
Illuminate me


-- 5/27/14
The office tonight
Becomes calm and deserted
Like my tired mind


-- 5/29/14
Familiar faces
Find each other at Bedford
Greeted with a kiss


-- 5/31/14
Petite frame twirls
Flashes of glittering skin
A tattooed flower


-- 6/3/14
The candle burning
At both ends of my long days
I'm still feeling bright

-- 6/4/14
Stopped by a bubble
Calmly floating in my way
As we greet, it pops

-- 6/5/14
I'm aloft again
Summer haze falls on New York
Cool clouds catch fire

-- 6/6/14
Dark tea leaves swirling
Glowing coals smoking nearby
Cat watches hookahs


-- 6/8/14
Canvas straining steel
Sun splashes with the ocean
Across our two hulls


-- 6/10/14
Lively street bazaar
Winding roads flanked by lanterns
Cold Turkish cider

-- 6/11/14
Apricot sunset
Casting orange on the bay
Two lonely ships watch



-- 6/18/14
See her crisp white dress,
Candlelight falling on it?
I can't stop seeing

-- 6/19/14
Lights in a dark room
Panels of energy spark
For me to harness


-- 6/26/14
Geodesic steel
Hefted into the warm air
Support our spirts

-- 6/27/14
Forest vibes lift me
Into a more blissful plane
High fives and smiles

-- 6/28/14
Bliss pumping through me
I'm electric, she's forest
Hearts beat our soundtrack

-- 6/29/14
Lounging in hammocks
Three deep, watching the forest
Lights dancing below


-- 7/3/14
Chased by the raindrops
Of a summer thunderstorm
I have to get wine!

-- 7/4/14
Wrapped in a blanket
She watches far-away lights
Silent explosions

-- 7/5/14
The city's flowers
Blooming on a summer day
Enjoying the park

-- 7/6/14
Two souls are talking
Through pixels and buttons pressed
Forging sparks of love

-- 7/8/14
Dog in a backpack
Watching the world go by
He's sleepy, like me

-- 7/9/14
Fireflies drift by
Saxophone notes stir sweet air
Washington Square Park

-- 7/10/14
Om scrawled on a lamp
Illuminating the street
Headlights rush on by

-- 7/11/14
Bright orb shining high
White light drifting through clear sky
Moonlight follows us

-- 7/12/14
Breezy summer night
Laughs bounce off Bushwick paintings
We're drunk on friendship

-- 7/13/14
San Francisco lights
Cast against the soft black hills
A dusting of stars


-- 7/16/14
Clouds roll over hills
Cooling sight; a deep breath out
Goleden sunset's warmth



-- 7/18/14
Photons dance brightly
Rhythms of silicon dreams
Sing our consciousness

-- 7/19/14
Dance through dirty streets
Swinging my thoughts by your love
You're all that I want

-- 7/21/14
The heat lies awake
Visited by films of sweat
And glimpses of dreams

-- 7/22/14
Sitting serenely
Eyes shut against the train bumps
Flowers on her shirt


-- 7/25/14
Summer night bike ride
Swiftly making my own breeze
Sound of rushing wheels

-- 7/26/14
Don't know why I dance
It seems the dance fills me, since
Bliss wants to happen

-- 7/27/14
Old whiskey bottle
Sitting calm on my bedside
Filled with frozen sparks

-- 7/28/14
Flavors of vapors
Clouding up this blank white room
Inhaling our buzz

-- 7/29/14
Two bodies curled
Held against the breaking dawn
Wanting just to stay

-- 7/31/14
The morning commute
Exhaust coats the summer air
Sounds of jackhammers

-- 8/2/14
Jovial rooftop
While one side of the Earth burns
The other hugs friends

-- 8/3/14
Blossoms in her hand
Summer shining in her cheek
And she in my eyes

-- 8/6/14
A thousand bodies
Rising at dawn just to dance
Sun on the river

-- 8/9/14
White dress among trees
Their love blessed by our presence
Our lives blessed with them

-- 8/11/14
Sickness coats my frame
Reminds me of my body
Wrapped in a blanket

-- 8/13/14
Bodies gripped by heat,
Remembering something new,
Forget exhaustion

-- 8/15/14
Dredge work; unearth cogs
Never meant to bear their weight
Wishing I hadn't

-- 8/16/14
Buzz of tattoo guns
Drumming the moment with change
Etching flesh with time

-- 8/17/14
Grey tear-stained morning
When family roots pass on
We must keep going

-- 8/21/14
Scottish forest air
Flows through my tired body
The soul's medecine

-- 8/22/14
Three generations
Once gathered round this table
Gather'd in our hearts

-- 8/23/14
Solemn souls standing
Cool Scottish air pools outside
Pine and love laid down

-- 8/26/14
Wind bleeds cross windows
Flesh of the country below
Touchdown in London

-- 8/28/14
Nights are cool again
Shop doors, still open, bleed light
Laughter jumping out

-- 8/30/14
Gentle rooftop breeze
Deep Bushwick; a DJ plays
Enter through the back

A friend's departure
Littered with tumbling relics
Life's machinery

A hot day; bad news
Gripping tight to rushing time
Makes it rush faster

Bright lights and bright tastes
Laugh of a drunken patron
Sip of sweet sake

Rush of white powder
Bright sting of a thunderbolt
The drug of friendship

The nights are cooling
Dust of the city smells dark
Ready for the cold

-- 9/10/14
Eyes of the city
Black cast on black; we're tired
The city and me

-- 9/13/14
Crisp day through windows
Another red flower blooms
Body recovers

-- 9/16/14
Sweet words sweet champagne
Sweet cake dry thoughts dry feelings
Searching for rainfall

-- 9/17/14
Autumn shower falls
Start the day through the curtain
Of seasons passing

-- 10/3/14 pt 2
An old paperback
Shedding leaves into my mind
Flakes of old wisdom

-- 10/5/14
A sunny smile
A shining girl, bright love
Bright diamond and gold

-- 10/7/14
Ephemeral notes
A rat scampers by my boots
Rain drops fall; Brooklyn

-- 10/15/14
The morning commute
Jostled against New Yorkers
Meet your city, kid

-- 10/17/14
MoÃ«t, anime
Bubbles rise in glass with thoughts
That pop and sparkle

-- 10/18/14
Flames of autumn rise
Through trees and time to remind
This is a cycle

-- 10/19/14
A dimsum palace
Women hawking steaming plates
Criss cross the carpet

-- 10/20/14
Flashes of bright art
Caught within a speeding train
While I hold her hand


-- 10/23/14
Whiskey glass; lip tats
Dark bar with darker eyes but
Our spirits are bright

-- 10/26/14
A koi fish comes near
To probe a fallen red leaf
Then sinks as I yawn

-- 10/31/14
Masked faces bright
The cold winds outside bring rain
Pretend to pretend

-- 11/2/14
Our own entropy
Twists and runs its swift beauty
Through our templed room

-- 11/3/14
This is a vessel
Taking me through the world
With which I wage love

-- 11/4/14
Jeweled fingers tap
Bright colors sweep and shimmer
The subway rolls on

-- 11/5/14
Islands of music
Our earbuds the shores of thought
Isolation train

-- 11/5/14 pt 2
A hundred thousand
Subway rides away from joy
I'll keep taking them

-- 11/6/14
Dancing puddles filled
By fat drops of city rain
Anchored with gravel

-- 11/11/14
Light fog- tide of cold
Wet air settles in the streets
By cigarette smoke

-- 11/12/14
Waking up to dream
A day away from ourselves;
Her sleep my respite

-- 11/14/14
Cold wind warm ramen
Serendipity remains
The best way to meet

-- 11/19/14
A cramped udon bar
It somehow feels more free than
The city outside

-- 11/20/14
Brass melodies play-
Approaching steel subway cars
Their own percussion

-- 11/21/14
Stacks of human thought
Bound with ink and board to time
Section: poetry

-- 11/23/14
Back from her travels
She's returned with heaps of gifts-
Her smile most treasured

-- 11/25/14
Pair of travelers
World spinning round us
I'm never alone

-- 11/26/14
Heart rate monitor
Sounding the rhythm of life
Through the waiting dark

-- 11/27/14
Stoke the red embers
Against the cold lonely wind
Burn away the old

-- 11/31/14 = 12/6/14 "A week of California"
Tides of jeweled tail lights
Flowing through the gentle hills
Quench the dry landscape

-- 12/7/14
Perched on an old rock
Sipping the sun as cars pass
Dew cooling my toes

-- 12/9/14 pt 2
Jet engines' hot path
Blurs flickering candle lights
Of suburbs below

-- 12/10/14
If New York missed me
It's not giving any sign
Black coats and snowflakes

-- 12/12/14
Another cold day
City of relentless change
It'll be Spring soon

-- 12/15/14
Smell of spice wafts by
Warm lights in the night as gifts
Are bartered and bought

-- 12/17/14
Towering projects
Stand hard against the navy sky
Scattered windows lit

-- 12/18/14
Silent commuters
Sharing the dark grey morning
Winter together
