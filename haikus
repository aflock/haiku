Fresh breath for breathing
Cool moist air sifts through my lungs
puddles shine silent

Typsy conversation
A bit of wisdom
A lot of cheer - winter -

A quiet smile
Soft light hits her auburn hair
swift turn - she's gone


2014

-- 1/5/14
Foggy City lights
Soft and warm in a cold sky
As I walk below

-- 1/6/14
Oil-slicked pavement
Sky reflects in grey rainbows
Dirty snow melting

-- 1/7/14
Single snowflake falls
Cold wind biting through my coat
I can't feel my legs

Crowded subway car
Hands of seven colors grab--
balance; headed home

Taste of coffee thawing me
While couples chatter

A small town's street lights below
Winter stars above

A California tree's shade
Sing the warmth goodbye

Deep Blue lake listens

The road hugging hills

Fall against this grey city
Searching for her warmth

Young children jump in puddles
By Spanish markets

I'm the youngest here; although
Being old seems fun

Clear, swift, bright computation
Extends forever

Seen through subway windows
The jeweleed skyline retreating
Behind bridges steel

Sweep under crisp winter's sun;
Man and pidgeons chat

Reflects the glow of candles
And noise of the bar

Bright steel gleams by worn leather
Sharp pinprick of change

Back to the warm Bay
I am a ping pong ball
Across the globe

Bike ride on pavement
Surrounding walls riddled by
Change's bright salvos

Slowly bleeding out the gray
From my tierd heart

Cali stars above

Falling darkly on the road
We glide through, chatting

In the middle of winter

Pressing my mind against it
Until the code works

Shared between two non-smokers
Smoldering ashes

Her face through liquid crystal
Warmth of shared smiles

As cars drift through streets

Fragile petals tremble now
By El Camino

You Draft for me and-
I'll dance and then together
We'll have it covered

Its fragrance dusts my hands
Color dusts my eyes

A ray of sun cuts through clouds
Snowfall of petals

The flavors become brighter;
The sounds of dishes

Announcing dawn with colors
Forged by the night's dreams

Caught by their weight on the glass
The chased by the wind

Illuminates the dust specks
As I write haiku

Cold winter air tempered by
Our cheer and chatter

The bright city blanketed
I'll return in Spring

As waves batter jagged rocks;

Holding hands, we say nothing
Nothing left unsaid

Cool breeze soothes my weary self
New York drumming past

-- 9/16/14
Sweet words sweet champagne
Sweet cake dry thoughts dry feelings
Searching for rainfall

-- 9/17/14
Autumn shower falls
Start the day through the curtain
Of seasons passing

-- 9/18/14
Cinnamon spiced yams
Heaped into aluminum
Shoveled into mouths

-- 9/19/14
Firefight brigade
Which wind has stopeed? We wonder
As the ship slows, stops

Ivory pieces
Proxies of my strategies
Falling to time, dust

-- 10/3/14 pt 2
An old paperback
Shedding leaves into my mind
Flakes of old wisdom

-- 10/4/14
Cold spitting showers
Run through Brooklyn avenues
Heralding autumn


-- 10/5/14
A sunny smile
A shining girl, bright love
Bright diamond and gold

-- 10/6/14
Brown haired couple walks
Two paces from holding hands
Hope I don't notice

-- 10/7/14
Ephemeral notes
A rat scampers by my boots
Rain drops fall; Brooklyn

-- 10/8/14
Cloud veils pass the moon
As tree leaves flow above me
White orb stays constant

-- 10/9/14
Walk by sheet metal
Graffiti is sun-dappled
Breeze is cool and bright

-- 10/10/14



-- 10/11/14

-- 10/12/14
Pretty day to waste
As sun runs through her beauty
My weariness fades

-- 10/13/14
Pinning memories
Tacks of soft remembrance
Onto our new wall

-- 10/14/14
Mosaic of code
Authors long gone speak softly
Through glimpses of loops

-- 10/15/14
The morning commute
Jostled against New Yorkers
Meet your city, kid

-- 10/16/14
Step onto the street
Feet float with the Broadway wind
Up to catch the train

-- 10/17/14
MoÃ«t, anime
Bubbles rise in glass with thoughts
That pop and sparkle

-- 10/18/14
Flames of autumn rise
Through trees and time to remind
This is a cycle

-- 10/19/14
A dimsum palace
Women hawking steaming plates
Criss cross the carpet

-- 10/20/14
Flashes of bright art
Caught within a speeding train
While I hold her hand

-- 10/21/14
Red lacquered drawers
Stuck with oriental brass
I focus on drilling

-- 10/22/14
Raindrops my soundtrack
Pass through this rainy city
Gliding by glances

-- 10/23/14
Whiskey glass; lip tats
Dar bar with darker eyes but
Our spirits are bright

-- 10/24/14
Weight of the world
Do you ungh or do you ahh
Shoulders weak as mine

-- 10/25/14
A blooming garden
Of fall possibilities
Bright petals fall soft

-- 10/26/14
A koi fish comes near
To probe a fallen red leaf
Then sinks as I yawn

-- 10/27/14
Ride through garment district
Closed pavillions of fashion
The damp air feels cool

-- 10/28/14
Two hands reach for steel
Then retract- a shared smile
Our New York moment

-- 10/29/14
A splash of whiskey
Oranges juggled in jest
Moments of chillin

-- 10/30/14
I see leaves yellowed
Hidden within green covers
School children playing

-- 10/31/14
Masked faces bright
The cold winds outside bring rain
Pretend to pretend

-- 11/1/14
Old suitcases sit
Next to them sits the future
Our feet make puddles

-- 11/2/14
Our own entropy
Twists and runs its swift beauty
Through our templed room

-- 11/3/14
This is a vessel
Taking me through the world
With which I wage love

-- 11/4/14
Jeweled fingers tap
Bright colors sweep and shimmer
The subway rolls on

-- 11/5/14
Islands of music
Our earbuds the shores of thought
Isolation train

-- 11/5/14 pt 2
A hundred thousand
Subway rides away from joy
I'll keep taking them

-- 11/6/14
Dancing puddles filled
By fat drops of city rain
Anchored with gravel

-- 11/7/14
Our warmth and comfort
Sinking into both our bones
Pizza in the bed

-- 11/8/14
Quick- warm your fingers
Over the crackling fire
We have to win this

-- 11/9/14
Turn the earth 'round me
Distract me from my own grey self
Creation is grace

-- 11/10/14
Assorted flora
Mosaics of fresh produce
But where's the damn cheese

-- 11/11/14
Light fog- tide of cold
Wet air settles in the streets
By cigarette smoke

-- 11/12/14
Waking up to dream
A day away from ourselves;
Her sleep my respite

-- 11/13/14
Rain lit by street light
Static orbs of movement
My head underneath

-- 11/14/14
Cold wind warm ramen
Serendipity remains
The best way to meet

-- 11/15/14
Chit chat while cleaning;
Our fruitful meditation
Ends with chocolate

-- 11/16/14
Grey skies over us
As fall approaches the land
Pockets of bright leaves

-- 11/17/14
Sweat early at dawn
So the rest of the day flows
My legs are burning!

-- 11/18/14
Wind biting our ears
As puddles crack underfoot
Thank god for thick coats

-- 11/19/14
A cramped udon bar
It somehow feels more free than
The city outside

-- 11/20/14
Brass melodies play-
Approaching steel subway cars
Their own percussion

-- 11/21/14
Stacks of human thought
Bound with ink and board to time
Section: poetry

-- 11/22/14
Wood burns- smoke drifts in
To marinate our brunch wait
With bars of sunlight

-- 11/23/14
Back from her travels
She's returned with heaps of gifts-
Her smile most treasured

-- 11/24/14
Sitting on a couch
Sonic tides bathe our moments
The smell of spilled beer

-- 11/25/14
Pair of travelers
World spinning round us
I'm never alone

-- 11/26/14
Heart rate monitor
Sounding the rhythm of life
Through the waiting dark

-- 11/27/14
Stoke the red embers
Against the cold lonely wind
Burn away the old

-- 11/28/14
Plumes of white vapor
Clouding a room amidst laughs
Dissipate slowly

-- 11/29/14
Marble chess pieces
Proxies of our strategies
Falling one by one

-- 11/30/14
New York City bound
I'm ferried millions of miles
Earth rotates below

-- 11/31/14 = 12/6/14 "A week of California"
Tides of jeweled tail lights
Flowing through the gentle hills
Quench the dry landscape

Hasty slipshod rain
Unplanned but needed, I'm wet
And cars are timid

-- 12/7/14
Perched on an old rock
Sipping the sun as cars pass
Dew cooling my toes

-- 12/8/14
Dark hills cut the sky
Fold over the winding road
The 101 drive

-- 12/9/14
Fog in the distance
Calming skies, beckoning rain
I'll see you next time

-- 12/9/14 pt 2
Jet engines' hot path
Blurs flickering candle lights
Of suburbs below

-- 12/10/14
If New York missed me
It's not giving any sign
Black coats and snowflakes

-- 12/11/14
Ramen for one please
Amid the first winter snow
Hot soup short pleasures


-- 12/12/14
Another cold day
City of relentless change
It'll be spring soon

-- 12/13/14
Gathered from four states
Hummer limo through Times Square
Brothers in our own

-- 12/14/14
Sunshine on the street
Bare trees claw the horizon
Sunny winter day

-- 12/15/14
Smell of spice wafts by
Warm lights in the night as gifts
Are bartered and bought

-- 12/16/14
Fragrant bites of cheese
Sips of six spice-infused beers...
I'm still hungry though

-- 12/17/14
Towering projects
Stand hard against the navy sky
Scattered windows lit

-- 12/18/14
Silent commuters
Sharing the dark grey morning
Winter together

-- 12/19/14
Culture and cocktails
Music no one dances to
Drowns out our voices

-- 12/20/14
Christmas present bought
Packages weigh on shoulders
Our own traditions

-- 12/21/14
Grey clouds hem me in
Confined by the slate raindrops
Warmth of my bedroom

== 2015 ==

-- 1/5/15
Electrics clatter
Spilled onto subway benches
We all turn an eye

-- 1/6/15
Put my earbuds in
Without anything playing
Snow dusts the city

-- 1/9/15
Icy Union Square
It's isolated somehow
My boots crunching salt

-- 1/13/15
Lemon cuts the air
Bright slices of fish pass by
Clouds roll overhead

-- 1/17/15
Dark blanket raindrops
Over the sleepy city
A comforting hush

-- 1/25/15
Depth of verdant hills
Cast against the horizon
White mountain peaks watch

-- 1/29/15
Ride past dark towers
Ground far below these steel beams
Relentless skyline

-- 2/3/15
White sun melts grey snow
As salt crusts our citied boots
Icicles falling

-- 2/14/15
Snowy valentine
Soft snowflakes blur the streetlamps
In East Williamsburg

-- 2/16/15
Jet streams churn the air
Bright braille of streetlamps grows small
Flying the night sky
