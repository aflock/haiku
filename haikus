--
Fresh breath for breathing
Cool moist air sifts through my lungs
puddles shine silent

--
Typsy conversation
A bit of wisdom
A lot of cheer - winter -

--
A quiet smile
Soft light hits her auburn hair
swift turn - she's gone


2014

-- 1/5/14
Foggy City lights
Soft and warm in a cold sky
As I walk below

-- 1/6/14
Oil-slicked pavement
Sky reflects in grey rainbows
Dirty snow melting

-- 1/7/14
Single snowflake falls
Cold wind biting through my coat
I can't feel my legs

-- 1/8/14
Crowded subway car
Hands of seven colors grab--
balance; headed home

-- 1/9/14
Cold day- warm cafÃ©
Taste of coffee thawing me
While couples chatter


-- 1/9/14 JFK->SFO
Frozen mists hang still
A small town's street lights below
Winter stars above

-- 1/10/14
Birds chirping under
A California tree's shade
Sing the warmth goodbye

-- 1/11/14
Wind rushing on pines
This cold song lasts centuries
Deep Blue lake listens

-- 1/12/14
Dying sun's colors
Smell of burning wood drifts down
The road hugging hills

-- 1/13/14
My faded senses
Fall against this grey city
Searching for her warmth

-- 1/14/14
Rain falls on Brooklyn;
Young children jump in puddles
By Spanish markets

-- 1/15/14
Breakfast in Midtown
I'm the youngest here; although
Being old seems fun

-- 1/15/14 R.I.P Sam Marateck
Showed me the magic
Clear, swift, bright computation
Extends forever

-- 1/16/14
Seen through subway windows
The jeweleed skyline retreating
Behind bridges steel

-- 1/17/14
Flurry of feathers
Sweep under crisp winter's sun;
Man and pidgeons chat

-- 1/18/14
Golden matte on slate
Reflects the glow of candles
And noise of the bar

-- 1/19/14
The tattoo parlor
Bright steel gleams by worn leather
Sharp pinprick of change

-- 1/20/14
Back to the warm Bay
I am a ping pong ball
Across the globe

-- 1/21/14
Bike ride on pavement
Surrounding walls riddled by
Change's bright salvos

-- 1/22/14
Chanting soft mantras
Slowly bleeding out the gray
From my tierd heart

-- 1/23/14
Bubbles in a pool
Turquoise lights dance below me
Cali stars above

-- 1/24/14
Jeweled hills rising
Falling darkly on the road
We glide through, chatting

-- 1/25/14
A sunny Spring day
In the middle of winter
San Francisco Hax

-- 1/26/14
Labrynth of logic
Pressing my mind against it
Until the code works

-- 1/27/14
A cigarette break
Shared between two non-smokers
Smoldering ashes

-- 1/28/14
Pixelated tears
Her face through liquid crystal
Warmth of shared smiles

-- 1/29/14
Strip mall parking lot
Night air compressed by ACs
As cars drift through streets

-- 1/30/14
Dew hangs on lillies
Fragile petals tremble now
By El Camino

-- 1/31/14
You Draft for me and-
I'll dance and then together
We'll have it covered

-- 2/1/14
This lavendar bush
Its fragrance dusts my hands
Color dusts my eyes

-- 2/2/14
Damp cherry blossoms
A ray of sun cuts through clouds
Snowfall of petals

-- 2/3/14
Solitary dinner
The flavors become brighter;
The sounds of dishes

-- 2/4/14
Sun peeks over hills
Announcing dawn with colors
Forged by the night's dreams

-- 2/5/14
Raindrops on windshields
Caught by their weight on the glass
The chased by the wind

-- 2/6/14
A dark room; one light
Illuminates the dust specks
As I write haiku

-- 2/7/14
Six thousand people
Helping a billion share love
Digital bhakti

-- 2/8/14
Some friends; a few drinks
Cold winter air tempered by
Our cheer and chatter

-- 2/9/14
Leaving as snow falls
The bright city blanketed
I'll return in Spring

-- 2/10/14
Seven laptops glow
Seventy fingers typing
Chorus of code

-- 2/11/14
Submerge my body
Bubbles fizz and swirl beside
Fingers prune; hot bath

-- 2/12/14
Even in winter
California sun shines warm
Moist breezes pass by

-- 2/13/14
Morning breakfast time
Eating alone together
His phone between us

-- 2/14/14
Dusk over Bay Bridge
Clouds roll over dark forests
Driving to Oakland

-- 2/15/14
Alcatraz Island
Drifts by - grey and abandoned
Metal sky; sea breeze

-- 2/16/14
Watching bright sunsets
As waves batter jagged rocks;
Turquoise succulents

-- 2/17/14
Walking empty streets
Holding hands, we say nothing
Nothing left unsaid

-- 2/18/14
Night; Highway driving
Solitary drivers trade lanes
Group meditation

-- 2/19/14
Dinner with colleagues
Knowledge shared with salt and bread
This is salary

-- 2/20/14
Hackathon midnight
Data cast in an image
Love's remnants, prgrammed

-- 2/21/14
A couple of beers
Cigarette smoke curls slow
Conversation too

-- 2/22/14
Tree bark twists around
Like spun yarn, woven to earth
Roots twisting below

-- 2/23/14
Cool mist rolling over
Pink magnolia petals
A finch chirps nearby

-- 2/24/14
A sip of coffee
Shaking the sleep from my eyes
The dust from my bones

-- 2/25/14
Sun shines on concrete
Slanted shadows meet the wall
Lost my sunglasses

-- 2/26/14
Rain beats down concrete
Tattoos the end of a drought
Lost my umbrella

-- 2/27/14
Rainbow by the road
Case against gray clouds
Coloring my drive

-- 2/28/14
Sonic meditation
Bathe me in bright melodies
Songs dance through bodies

-- 3/1/14
Flurry of gray skies
Skyscrapers grow from concrete
Cold air sharpens thoughts

-- 3/2/14
Snow falls with the night
I forgot my sweater, so
Her smile keeps me warm

-- 3/3/14
Sunset; Paintbrush skies
Tides of clouds on seas of air
Flash gold, then darkness

-- 3/3/14 L train USQ->DeKalb
Salt-stained subway floor
Scuffed winter boots and black coats
This season's commute

-- 3/4/14
City grit and sounds
Chaos and harmony blend
Rats run underfoot

-- 3/5/14
Time to recharge us
Falling into each other
Glass of scotch in hand

-- 3/6/14
Sleep settles on me
Night settles the sun's retreat
Stars wander through clouds

-- 3/7/14
Spotted stairway steps
Stained with salt from season's pass
Run past; catch the train

-- 3/8/14
Sun on her sonft face
She drifts in between my dreams
A flower, sleeping

-- 3/9/14
A perfect circle
Shattered, a fractal pattern
Cut my thumb on glass

-- 3/10/14
Queensboro roman
We map neurons to circuits
Programmed via love

-- 3/11/14
Bits bounce between us
Thoughts exchanged over copper
Pixelated chill

-- 3/12/14
Your warm sleeping face
So hard to leave this morning
Drooling on pillows

-- 3/13/14
Last chill before spring
Tap of heels on cold concrete
Still can see my breath

-- 3/14/14
A pidgeon perches
On a gray stone gargoyle
City's audience

-- 3/15/14
Guitars in the air
Melodies dance together
A small crowd gathers

-- 3/16/14
Lazy day in bed
Leaving only for late brunch
Rejuvenation

-- 3/17/14
Balck and white stones fight
Placed by silent generals
Peaceful war, for once

-- 3/18/14
Painted eyes glance up
Black hair, black jacket, black boots
Flash of golden rings

-- 3/19/14
Six feet, eight inches
Yet somehow he seems too short
Time out; Brooklyn ball!

-- 3/20/14
ALmost dodged winter
But a cold snuck up on me
I'm out of tissues!

-- 3/21/14
Strangers at the bar
Ordered too many olives
Fuck it, let's share them

-- 3/22/14
The first sunny day
Strolling around the city
Soak up Manhattan

-- 3/23/14
Biking in Brooklyn
Rubber feathers, on steel wings
Flying over concrete

-- 3/24/14


-- 3/25/14

-- 3/26/14

-- 3/28/14
