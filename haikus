Fresh breath for breathing
Cool moist air sifts through my lungs
puddles shine silent

--
Typsy conversation
A bit of wisdom
A lot of cheer - winter -

--
A quiet smile
Soft light hits her auburn hair
swift turn - she's gone


2014

-- 1/5/14
Foggy City lights
Soft and warm in a cold sky
As I walk below

-- 1/6/14
Oil-slicked pavement
Sky reflects in grey rainbows
Dirty snow melting

-- 1/7/14
Single snowflake falls
Cold wind biting through my coat
I can't feel my legs

-- 1/8/14
Crowded subway car
Hands of seven colors grab--
balance; headed home

-- 1/9/14
Cold day- warm cafÃ©
Taste of coffee thawing me
While couples chatter


-- 1/9/14 JFK->SFO
Frozen mists hang still
A small town's street lights below
Winter stars above

-- 1/10/14
Birds chirping under
A California tree's shade
Sing the warmth goodbye

-- 1/11/14
Wind rushing on pines
This cold song lasts centuries
Deep Blue lake listens

-- 1/12/14
Dying sun's colors
Smell of burning wood drifts down
The road hugging hills

-- 1/13/14
My faded senses
Fall against this grey city
Searching for her warmth

-- 1/14/14
Rain falls on Brooklyn;
Young children jump in puddles
By Spanish markets

-- 1/15/14
Breakfast in Midtown
I'm the youngest here; although
Being old seems fun

-- 1/15/14 R.I.P Sam Marateck
Showed me the magic
Clear, swift, bright computation
Extends forever

-- 1/16/14
Seen through subway windows
The jeweleed skyline retreating
Behind bridges steel

-- 1/17/14
Flurry of feathers
Sweep under crisp winter's sun;
Man and pidgeons chat

-- 1/18/14
Golden matte on slate
Reflects the glow of candles
And noise of the bar

-- 1/19/14
The tattoo parlor
Bright steel gleams by worn leather
Sharp pinprick of change

-- 1/20/14
Back to the warm Bay
I am a ping pong ball
Across the globe

-- 1/21/14
Bike ride on pavement
Surrounding walls riddled by
Change's bright salvos

-- 1/22/14
Chanting soft mantras
Slowly bleeding out the gray
From my tierd heart

-- 1/23/14
Bubbles in a pool
Turquoise lights dance below me
Cali stars above

-- 1/24/14
Jeweled hills rising
Falling darkly on the road
We glide through, chatting

-- 1/25/14
A sunny Spring day
In the middle of winter
San Francisco Hax

-- 1/26/14
Labrynth of logic
Pressing my mind against it
Until the code works

-- 1/27/14
A cigarette break
Shared between two non-smokers
Smoldering ashes

-- 1/28/14
Pixelated tears
Her face through liquid crystal
Warmth of shared smiles

-- 1/29/14
Strip mall parking lot
Night air compressed by ACs
As cars drift through streets

-- 1/30/14
Dew hangs on lillies
Fragile petals tremble now
By El Camino

-- 1/31/14
You Draft for me and-
I'll dance and then together
We'll have it covered

-- 2/1/14
This lavendar bush
Its fragrance dusts my hands
Color dusts my eyes

-- 2/2/14
Damp cherry blossoms
A ray of sun cuts through clouds
Snowfall of petals

-- 2/3/14
Solitary dinner
The flavors become brighter;
The sounds of dishes

-- 2/4/14
Sun peeks over hills
Announcing dawn with colors
Forged by the night's dreams

-- 2/5/14
Raindrops on windshields
Caught by their weight on the glass
The chased by the wind

-- 2/6/14
A dark room; one light
Illuminates the dust specks
As I write haiku

-- 2/7/14
Six thousand people
Helping a billion share love
Digital bhakti

-- 2/8/14
Some friends; a few drinks
Cold winter air tempered by
Our cheer and chatter

-- 2/9/14
Leaving as snow falls
The bright city blanketed
I'll return in Spring

-- 2/10/14
Seven laptops glow
Seventy fingers typing
Chorus of code

-- 2/11/14
Submerge my body
Bubbles fizz and swirl beside
Fingers prune; hot bath

-- 2/12/14
Even in winter
California sun shines warm
Moist breezes pass by

-- 2/13/14
Morning breakfast time
Eating alone together
His phone between us

-- 2/14/14
Dusk over Bay Bridge
Clouds roll over dark forests
Driving to Oakland

-- 2/15/14
Alcatraz Island
Drifts by - grey and abandoned
Metal sky; sea breeze

-- 2/16/14
Watching bright sunsets
As waves batter jagged rocks;
Turquoise succulents

-- 2/17/14
Walking empty streets
Holding hands, we say nothing
Nothing left unsaid

-- 2/18/14
Night; Highway driving
Solitary drivers trade lanes
Group meditation

-- 2/19/14
Dinner with colleagues
Knowledge shared with salt and bread
This is salary

-- 2/20/14
Hackathon midnight
Data cast in an image
Love's remnants, prgrammed

-- 2/21/14
A couple of beers
Cigarette smoke curls slow
Conversation too

-- 2/22/14
Tree bark twists around
Like spun yarn, woven to earth
Roots twisting below

-- 2/23/14
Cool mist rolling over
Pink magnolia petals
A finch chirps nearby

-- 2/24/14
A sip of coffee
Shaking the sleep from my eyes
The dust from my bones

-- 2/25/14
Sun shines on concrete
Slanted shadows meet the wall
Lost my sunglasses

-- 2/26/14
Rain beats down concrete
Tattoos the end of a drought
Lost my umbrella

-- 2/27/14
Rainbow by the road
Case against gray clouds
Coloring my drive

-- 2/28/14

Bathe me in bright melodies
Songs dance through bodies

Skyscrapers grow from concrete
Cold air sharpens thoughts

Snow falls with the night
I forgot my sweater, so
Her smile keeps me warm

Sunset; Paintbrush skies
Tides of clouds on seas of air
Flash gold, then darkness

-- 3/3/14 L train USQ->DeKalb
Salt-stained subway floor
Scuffed winter boots and black coats
This season's commute

-- 3/4/14
City grit and sounds
Chaos and harmony blend
Rats run underfoot

-- 3/5/14
Time to recharge us
Falling into each other
Glass of scotch in hand

-- 3/6/14
Sleep settles on me
Night settles the sun's retreat
Stars wander through clouds

-- 3/7/14
Spotted stairway steps
Stained with salt from season's pass
Run past; catch the train

-- 3/8/14
Sun on her sonft face
She drifts in between my dreams
A flower, sleeping

-- 3/9/14
A perfect circle
Shattered, a fractal pattern
Cut my thumb on glass

-- 3/10/14
Queensboro roman
We map neurons to circuits
Programmed via love

Bits bounce between us
Thoughts exchanged over copper
Pixelated chill

-- 3/12/14
Your warm sleeping face
So hard to leave this morning
Drooling on pillows

-- 3/13/14
Last chill before spring
Tap of heels on cold concrete
Still can see my breath

A pidgeon perches
On a gray stone gargoyle
City's audience

Guitars in the air
Melodies dance together
A small crowd gathers

Lazy day in bed
Leaving only for late brunch
Rejuvenation

Balck and white stones fight
Placed by silent generals
Peaceful war, for once

Painted eyes glance up
Black hair, black jacket, black boots
Flash of golden rings

Six feet, eight inches
Yet somehow he seems too short
Time out; Brooklyn ball!

ALmost dodged winter
But a cold snuck up on me
I'm out of tissues!

Strangers at the bar
Ordered too many olives
Fuck it, let's share them

The first sunny day
Strolling around the city
Soak up Manhattan

-- 3/23/14
Biking in Brooklyn
Rubber feathers, on steel wings
Flying over concrete

-- 3/24/14
After a long day
Her body is warm iron
My bones warm magnets

-- 3/25/14
Pink lights on blonde hair
Her voice or the lightshow-
Which one is brighter?

-- 3/26/14
Last leg of Winter
Looks like it'll be rainstorms
That send it away

A forgotten day
A new rhythm becomes plain
Settled down again

Replicas at fingertips
Conjure love from bits

A few more grey skies, but then
The city will bloom

Blooming through the dull colors
That subways provide

Scent filling the room

Pulls on an e-cig

Poling through the gray concrete
We're both waking up

Pass lights of an idle car
Shadows kicking dust

The city is a playground
Now the sun is out

Between subway stops

Missing a back wheel

Laughter in loud bars
