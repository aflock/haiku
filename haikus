Fresh breath for breathing
Cool moist air sifts through my lungs
puddles shine silent

--
Typsy conversation
A bit of wisdom
A lot of cheer - winter -

--
A quiet smile
Soft light hits her auburn hair
swift turn - she's gone


2014

-- 1/5/14
Foggy City lights
Soft and warm in a cold sky
As I walk below

-- 1/6/14
Oil-slicked pavement
Sky reflects in grey rainbows
Dirty snow melting

-- 1/7/14
Single snowflake falls
Cold wind biting through my coat
I can't feel my legs

-- 1/8/14
Crowded subway car
Hands of seven colors grab--
balance; headed home

-- 1/9/14
Cold day- warm cafÃ©
Taste of coffee thawing me
While couples chatter


-- 1/9/14 JFK->SFO
Frozen mists hang still
A small town's street lights below
Winter stars above

-- 1/10/14
Birds chirping under
A California tree's shade
Sing the warmth goodbye

-- 1/11/14
Wind rushing on pines
This cold song lasts centuries
Deep Blue lake listens

-- 1/12/14
Dying sun's colors
Smell of burning wood drifts down
The road hugging hills

-- 1/13/14
My faded senses
Fall against this grey city
Searching for her warmth

-- 1/14/14
Rain falls on Brooklyn;
Young children jump in puddles
By Spanish markets

-- 1/15/14
Breakfast in Midtown
I'm the youngest here; although
Being old seems fun

-- 1/15/14 R.I.P Sam Marateck
Showed me the magic
Clear, swift, bright computation
Extends forever

-- 1/16/14
Seen through subway windows
The jeweleed skyline retreating
Behind bridges steel

-- 1/17/14
Flurry of feathers
Sweep under crisp winter's sun;
Man and pidgeons chat

-- 1/18/14
Golden matte on slate
Reflects the glow of candles
And noise of the bar

-- 1/19/14
The tattoo parlor
Bright steel gleams by worn leather
Sharp pinprick of change

-- 1/20/14
Back to the warm Bay
I am a ping pong ball
Across the globe

-- 1/21/14
Bike ride on pavement
Surrounding walls riddled by
Change's bright salvos

-- 1/22/14
Chanting soft mantras
Slowly bleeding out the gray
From my tierd heart

-- 1/23/14
Bubbles in a pool
Turquoise lights dance below me
Cali stars above

-- 1/24/14
Jeweled hills rising
Falling darkly on the road
We glide through, chatting

-- 1/25/14
A sunny Spring day
In the middle of winter
San Francisco Hax

-- 1/26/14
Labrynth of logic
Pressing my mind against it
Until the code works

-- 1/27/14
A cigarette break
Shared between two non-smokers
Smoldering ashes

-- 1/28/14
Pixelated tears
Her face through liquid crystal
Warmth of shared smiles

-- 1/29/14
Strip mall parking lot
Night air compressed by ACs
As cars drift through streets

-- 1/30/14
Dew hangs on lillies
Fragile petals tremble now
By El Camino

-- 1/31/14
You Draft for me and-
I'll dance and then together
We'll have it covered

-- 2/1/14
This lavendar bush
Its fragrance dusts my hands
Color dusts my eyes

-- 2/2/14
Damp cherry blossoms
A ray of sun cuts through clouds
Snowfall of petals

-- 2/3/14
Solitary dinner
The flavors become brighter;
The sounds of dishes

-- 2/4/14
Sun peeks over hills
Announcing dawn with colors
Forged by the night's dreams

-- 2/5/14
Raindrops on windshields
Caught by their weight on the glass
The chased by the wind

-- 2/6/14
A dark room; one light
Illuminates the dust specks
As I write haiku

-- 2/7/14
Six thousand people
Helping a billion share love
Digital bhakti

Some friends; a few drinks
Cold winter air tempered by
Our cheer and chatter

-- 2/9/14
Leaving as snow falls
The bright city blanketed
I'll return in Spring

-- 2/10/14
Seven laptops glow
Seventy fingers typing
Chorus of code

-- 2/11/14
Submerge my body
Bubbles fizz and swirl beside
Fingers prune; hot bath

Even in winter
California sun shines warm
Moist breezes pass by

Eating alone together
His phone between us

Clouds roll over dark forests
Driving to Oakland

Alcatraz Island
Drifts by - grey and abandoned
Metal sky; sea breeze

Watching bright sunsets
As waves batter jagged rocks;
Turquoise succulents

Holding hands, we say nothing
Nothing left unsaid

Like spun yarn, woven to earth
Roots twisting below

A finch chirps nearby

Shaking the sleep from my eyes
The dust from my bones

Stars wander through clouds

Stained with salt from season's pass
Run past; catch the train

She drifts in between my dreams
A flower, sleeping

Programmed via love

So hard to leave this morning
Drooling on pillows

Tap of heels on cold concrete
Still can see my breath

Rubber feathers, on steel wings
Flying over concrete

Her body is warm iron
My bones warm magnets

Her voice or the lightshow-
Which one is brighter?
